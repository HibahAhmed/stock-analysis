# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project 

### Steve's parents are investing in Daqo New Energy Corporation (DQ). Both green energy as well as DQ stocks are analyzed with the help of VBA. VBA is a programing language that is being used in this module to help make calculations and analyze using code which decreases possible errors and miscalculations.

### The first image protrays the stocks during 2017. It shows that there was a negative return percentage for TERP. The second image shows the stocks during 2018. The 2018 demonstrates only two positive returns which are with ENPH and RUN. The color changes to highlight the values, we used conditional statements. If the numerical value is greater than 0, ( If Cells(i, 3) > 0 Then) then Green would be displayed and if the value is less than 0, (ElseIf Cells(i, 3) < 0 Then) is used to show a negative value is displayed in red. Through code, we were also able to add a heafer row, starting and ending prices and loops to be able to analysize without coding each part.

## Summary

### Refactoring code is the process of editing anf changing on existening code all the while keeping the goal of the code consistent. It can be very useful in maintaining and fixing codde. It is also common to reconstruct a code and make last minute changes. However, there are also some cons to refactoring code. Sometimes refactoring code can taje longer than writing the code itself and this can lead to issues in the code later. The VBA script was very helpful in refacotring and made the VBA script easier and faster to refactor. However, it can also get very confusing at times with the different scipts and the minor changes which lead to other errors that were not present before therefore, leading to more time being spent on the code itself.
